The following materials are necessary to build the FPGA
timetagger. While we have provided example vendors and parts numbers
for many of these parts, these may no longer be offered when you go to
purchase. Don't hesitate to contact the authors so that we can offer
suggested substitutes and update this documentation.

In addition to the parts listed, assembly will require a reasonable
soldering station and appropriate solder.
