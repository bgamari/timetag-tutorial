The functionality of the FPGA timetagger is primarily accessed through
two graphical interfaces provided by {\tt timetag\_tools}: {\tt
 timetag\_ui} and {\tt timetag\_seq\_ui}. These are both installed in
the system application list as shown in \ref{Fig:Dash}.

\section{Timetagger UI}

The timetagger interface, {\tt timetag\_ui}, is a
