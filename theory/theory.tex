The FPGA timetagger has a number of modular components. In this
section we will describe these pieces and how they fit together into
the larger system.

\end{figure}

\section{FPGA implementation}
The core of the timetagger is implemented on the Xylo EM's Altera
EP2C5 FPGA. The logic is written in Verilog and can be found in the
{\tt timetag\_fpga} repository. As seen in FPGA block of
\ref{Fig:BlockDiagram}, the logic can be broken into a few functional
blocks,

\begin{itemize}
  \item event tagger: The core of the timetagger. Responsible for
    detecting events and producing timetagger records which are then
    queued in the sample FIFO
  \item sample FIFO: This is a buffer where event records wait until
    they can be sent to the FX2
  \item FX2 interface: This is a state machine which multiplexes
    access to the FX2 FIFO interface
  \item Register interface: This parses out commands from the host
    into register operations used to configure the various blocks of
    the device
\end{itemize}

Some of the discussion below will refer to details of the USB bus. The
interested reader is urged to read the Wikipedia article on this
subject and at very least the ``System Design''
section\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usb\#System\_design}}.

\subsection{Record format}
The record format (found in {\tt timetag-fpga/docs/timetag-format}) is

\section{FX2 USB device}
The USB bus requires a complex protocol which would be difficult to
implement on an FPGA alone. For this reason, the Xylo EM board
includes a dedicated USB interface device, the Cypress FX2. This
device includes a USB engine, a few FIFOs to buffer data sent and
received from the bus, and a 8051 processor for high level
control. This microcontroller runs the firmware found in the
{\tt timetag\_fx2} repository. This firmware configures the device as
a simple USB passthrough as seen in \ref{Table:Endpoints}.

\begin{table}
  \begin{tabular}{|lll|}
    \hline
    Endpoint & Direction      & Purpose \\
    \hline
    EP2      & Host-to-Device & Commands from host to FPGA \\
    EP6      & Device-to-Host & Data from FPGA to host \\
    EP8      & Device-to-Host & Command replies from FPGA to host \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{USB endpoint configuration}
  \label{Table:Endpoints}
\end{table}

The FX2 firmware has only a couple commands of its own as described in
{\tt timetag-fx2/README}. These are to adjust the queue depth (how
many records to queue up before sending a USB packet, exposed in
{\tt timetag\_ui} as the ``USB latency'').

\section{\tt timetag\_acquire}
{\tt timetag\_acquire} is a daemon which communicates with and
multiplexes access to the timetagger hardware. It is responsible for
abstracting the device's register interface and presents an ASCII
command interface through ZeroMQ socket,
({\tt /tmp/timetag-ctrl}). One can interface directly with the daemon
with the {\tt timetag-cli} utility,

\begin{verbatim}
$ timetag-cli capture?
1
\end{verbatim}

A description of the commands supported by this interface is available
with the {\tt help} command.

\section{\tt timetag\_ui}

{\tt timetag\_ui} is a Python GTK+ interface to the timetagging
functionality of the hardware. It communicates with {\tt
timetag\_acquire} through a UNIX domain socket and relies on several
of the other utilities in {\tt timetag\_tools} for low-level
processing of the incoming data stream (namely {\tt timetag\_bin}).

The capture backend (e.g. {\tt timetag\_acquire}) is somewhat
abstracted from the user interface and is handled by the {\tt
CapturePipeline} class.

\subsection{Metadata}

On starting a data acquisition run, {\tt timetag_ui} will write two files: 
{\tt FILE.timetag} contains the timestamp data coming from the
instrument while {\tt FILE.timetag.meta} is a JSON document containing
various metadata about the experiment and instrument configuration.

\subsection{Integration with other systems}

{\tt timetag_ui} has a variety of features which make it possible to
easily integrate with other instruments, software, and procedures.
These are namely {\it metadata hooks} and {\it acquisition
hooks}. Following in the UNIX tradition, these are scripts located in
specific directories which are executed when certain events occur.

When a hook is executed the {\tt TIMETAG_OUTPUT} environment variable
is set to the name of the active output file (if any).

\subsubsection{Metadata hooks}

Metadata hooks are run when an acquisition to a file is started. They
are expected to write a properly formatted JSON document to standard
output. This JSON document will be merged into the metadata written to
the {\tt .meta} file corresponding to the output file. Note that it is
expected that metadata hooks are short-lived tasks; {\tt timetag_ui}
will hang until all of the metadata hooks have finished.

\subsubsection{Acquisition hooks}

Acquisition hooks are run whenever read-out is started and terminated
with {\tt SIGTERM} when read-out is stopped. This facility is intended
to allow for collection of external instrument parameters
(e.g. excitation laser power) while an experiment is underway.

\section{\tt timetag\_seq\_ui}

{\tt timetag\_seq\_ui} is a Python GTK+ interface to the sequencer
functionality of the hardware.
